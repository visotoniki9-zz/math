# Linear Equations

A linear equation is an algebraic equation that forms a straight line when graphed. Each term is either a constant, or the product of a constant and a single variable.

A linear equation can have one or more dependent variables. For example, the following equation expresses the total cost of buying a apples at \$0.50 eac and b bananas for \$0.30 each. $\text{Cost } = a \times \$0.50 + b \times \$0.30$. The total cost is dependent, and will vary if aa or bb is changed.

## Linear Rate of Change

A linear rate of change means that the value being discussed changes by a fixed amount in a given unit of time. This means that the slope of the equation will be a constant value and that a graph of the relationship will be a straight line.

When relationships involve a linear rate of change, it is usually simplest to represent them as a linear equation in slope-intercept form:
$$y = mx+ b$$
In this formula, y represents our final amount, m is the rate of change or the slope of the line, x is the time elapsed (in the same units as m), and b is the amount we started with at time $x=0$.

> EXAMPLE
> The library loses 100 books every week. If they currently have 10,000 books, how many weeks will it be before they have only 8400 books?
> $$8400=-100x+10000$$ 
> $$x=\frac{8400-10000}{-100}=16$$

## Finding the Slope of a Line

The slope-intercept formula of a line is given by $y = mx + b$, where $m$ and $b$ are fixed numbers. The set of points satisfying this equation describes a straight line in the $xy$-plane.

The slope of a line is the ratio between the change of $y$ and the change of $x$. For example, for two different points on a line, $p_1= (x_1, y_1)$ and $p_2=(x_2,y_2)$, the slope is equal to the ratio $\frac{y_2 - y1 }{x_2 - x_1}$.
This is also known as the rate of change of yy with respect to xx.

Slope is sometimes expressed as rise over run. Students who forget which component is the numerator might want to visualize determining slope as walking up a flight of stairs. The vertical change comes first (is the numerator), and is followed by the horizontal change (the denominator).

For the line $y=mx+b$, the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$ is always equal to the slope $m$ for any pair of distinct points on the line, which can be calculated as follows:
$$\frac{ y_2 - y_1 } { x_2 - x_1 } = \frac{ (mx_2 + b) - (mx_1 + b) } { x_2 - x_1} = \frac{ m (x_2 - x_1) } { x_2 - x_1} = m.$$

## Forms of Linear Equations

The three major forms of linear equations are [slope-intercept form](#slope-intercept-form), [point-slope form](#point-slope-form), and [standard form](#standard-form).

### Slope Intercept Form

The slope-intercept form is
$$y = mx + b$$
It provides us with two important pieces of information about the graph of a line: the slope $m$ and the $y$-intercept $(0, b )(0,b)$.

> EXAMPLE
> What is the slope of $y = 2x +3$?
> Since the slope is the value of $m$, we can see that the slope of this equation is 2.

> EXAMPLE
> What is the y-intercept 0f $y=-4x+10?$
> Since the y-intercept occurs when $x=0$, we can see that the y-intercept is 10.

### Point-Slope

We use point-slope form when we know a point $(x_1,y_1)$ on the line, and the slope $m$. Given this information, the equation of the line is
$$(y-y_1)=m(x-x_1)$$

> EXAMPLE
> Find the equation of the straight line that passes through the point $(3,5)$ and has slope $-2$.
> From the point-slope form, the equation is $(y-5)=-2(x-3)$, which can be simplified as
> $$y=-2x+11$$

> EXAMPLE
> Find the equation of the line which passes through the points $P=(1,7)$ and $Q=(-1,-3)$.
> The slope of the line is $m=\frac{7-(-3)}{1-(-1)}=\frac{10}{2}=5$. Hence, the equation of the line is
> $(y-7)=5(x-1)$ or $y=5x+2$

### Standard Form

The standard form of a line is $Ax+By=C$ . $A$, $B$, and $C$ are integers.
This form of a line is particularly useful for determining both the x- and y-intercepts.  
We can determine the x-intercept of the line by substituting 0 for y and solving for x.
We can determine the y-intercept of the line by substituting 0 for x and solving for y.

> EXAMPLE
> If the equation of a line is $3x+5y=60$, what are the x-intercept and y-intercept of the line?
>
> To find the x-intercept, we substitute y for 0 and solve:
> $3x+5(0)=60$  
> $3x=60$  
> $x=20$
>
> To find the y-intercept, we substitute x for 0 and solve:
> $3(0)+5y=60$  
> $5y=60$  
> $y=12$
>
> The x-intercept is (20,0) and the y-intercept is (0,12),

> EXAMPLE
> If the x-intercept and y-intercept of a line are (5,0) and (0,6), respectively, what is the equation of the line?
> Dividing both sides of the standard equation by C yields the equation $\frac{A}{C}x+\frac{B}{C}y=1$. Given this equation, the x-intercept is $(\frac{C}{A},0)$ and the y-intercept is $(0,\frac{C}{B})$.
> Since our x-intercept is 5, $\frac{A}{C}=\frac{1}{5}$.
> Since our y-intercept is 6, $\frac{A}{C}=\frac{1}{6}$.
> Substituting our known values into the equation, we have $\frac{1}{5}x+\frac{1}{6}y=1$.
> Multiplying both sides by 30 yields $6x+5y=30$.

## Equations of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

### Parallel Lines

Parallel lines are those that do not meet at any point int the xyz-plane. The are different lines that have the same slope. Suppose we are given two non-vertical lines in slope-intercept form:
$$y=m_1x+b_1$$
$$y=m_2x+b_2$$
Then the two lines are parallel if $m_1=m_2$ and $b_1 \neq b_2$

> EXAMPLE
> What is the equation of the line that is parallel to the line $2x-3y-8=0$ and passes through the point $(3,5)$?
> Let $y=ax+b$ be the equation of the line of interest. Then since this line is parallel to the line $2x-3y-8=0$ or $y=\frac{2x}{3}-\frac{8}{3}$, the slope of which is $\frac{2}{3}$, so it must be true that $a=\frac{2}{3}$. So, the equation now becomes $y=\frac{2}{3}x+b$. Substituting in the coordinates (3,5), we have
> $$5=\frac{2}{3} \times 3 + b $$

### Perpendicular Lines

A pair of lines is perpendicular if the lines meet at $90^{\circ}$ angle. Given two non-vertical lines in slope-intercept form
$$y=m_1x+b_1$$
$$y=m_2x+b_2$$
the two lines are perpendicular if $m_1=-\frac{1}{m_2}$,that is, if the slopes are negative reciprocals of each other.

> EXAMPLE
> What is the equation of the line that passes through the point $(-7,3)$ and is perpendicular to the line $(y=\frac{1}{5}x-2)$?
> Let $(y=ax+b)$ be the equation of the line of interest. Then since this line is perpendicular to the line $(y=\frac{1}{5}x-2)$ the slope of which is $\frac{1}{5}$, it must be true that a=-5. So, the equation now becomes $y=-5x+b$. Substituting in the coordinates $(-7,3)$, we have
> $$3=-5\times (-7) + b \implies b=-32$$
> Therefore, the equation of the line of interest is
> $$y=-5x-32$$

> EXAMPLE
> Consider two lines $y=-2x+3$ and $y=(K+1)x+4$. When $K=a$, the two lines are parallel. When $K=b$, the two lines are perpendicular. What is $a+b$ ?
> Observe that the slope of the line $y=-2x+3$ is $-2$ and the slope of the line $y=(K+1)x+4$ is $K+1$.
> Then, since the two lines are parallel when $K=a$, it follow that
> $$a+1=-2 \implies a=-3$$
> Similarly, since the two lines are perpendicular when $K=b$, it follows that 
> $$b+1=\frac{1}{2} \implies b=-\frac{1}{2}$$
> Therefore, our answer is 
> $$a+b=-3-\frac{1}{2}=-\frac{7}{2}$$
